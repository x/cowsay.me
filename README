The original version fit into a tweet:

Unfortunately, that version required a dedicated linux instance. And, I've spun
those down. So, this is the new version deployed to heroku and using flask
instead of netcat and python equivilents to cowsay and fortune. It's not as
magical as the tweet-length one-liner, but I still own the domain so I feel I
should at least get it working again.
